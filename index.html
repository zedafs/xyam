ChatGPT
It looks like you have a basic HTML structure for a personal website. Here are a few observations and suggestions:

Duplicate ID in Header:

The <h4 id="name"> and <h1 id="name"> elements both have the same "name" ID. IDs should be unique within a page. You might want to use a different ID for the <h4> element or combine them into one.
Invalid HTML in Header:

It seems like there's a mistake in the <h4 id="name"> element. The opening tag is not closed properly. You might want to fix it like this:
html
Copy code
<h4 id="name"></h4>
Missing JavaScript Implementation:

There's a reference to script.js at the bottom of the body, but the content of the script file is not provided. Make sure your JavaScript file is correctly implemented if you have functionality that relies on it.
Spelling Mistake in Footer:

"pawered" should be spelled as "powered."
Responsive Design:

Ensure that your website is responsive by using the viewport meta tag. You've already included it, which is great (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">).
Alt Attributes for Images:

If you have images in your website, consider adding descriptive alt attributes to enhance accessibility.
Accessibility:

Consider adding more accessibility features such as ARIA roles and ensuring that your website is navigable using a keyboard.
Testing:

Test your website on different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
Overall, your HTML structure is a good starting point. Just make sure to address the mentioned points for better functionality and presentation.

function updateDateTime() {
    const dateTimeElement = document.getElementById('datetime');
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const options = { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric', second: 'numeric', timeZoneName: 'short' };
    const formattedDate = currentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', options);
    dateTimeElement.textContent = formattedDate;
}

updateDateTime(); // Initial call

// Update date and time every second
setInterval(updateDateTime, 1000);
ChatGPT
Your JavaScript code looks good. It's a simple script that updates the date and time every second on your webpage. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

updateDateTime Function:

Retrieves the element with the ID 'datetime' from the DOM.
Creates a new Date object representing the current date and time.
Defines options for formatting the date using the toLocaleDateString method.
Formats the current date using the specified options.
Updates the content of the 'datetime' element with the formatted date.
Initial Call:

The updateDateTime() function is called initially to set the date and time when the page loads.
setInterval Function:

Calls the updateDateTime function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second), ensuring that the date and time on the webpage are updated continuously.
Overall, this script is effective for displaying a live updating date and time on your webpage. Just make sure that the HTML element with the ID 'datetime' exists in your HTML structure, as the script relies on it for updating the content.

ChatGPT
Your CSS looks well-structured and organized. Here are a few comments and suggestions:

Background Image URL:

It seems like the URL you've used for the background image is a Google search result link. It's better to use a direct link to the image file itself. If you don't have a direct link, consider downloading the image and hosting it yourself or using a reliable image hosting service.
Switch Styling:

The styling for the switches is clean and effective. The use of a hidden input and the :before pseudo-element for the slider is a good approach.
Button Styling:

The styling for the buttons is clear and simple. The hover effect provides a nice visual indication. You may consider adding more styling for focus and active states to enhance accessibility.
Footer Styling:

The fixed position of the footer at the bottom of the page is suitable for a consistent layout. Ensure that the content above the footer does not overlap or hide behind it.
Responsive Design:

Consider testing your website on various screen sizes to ensure a responsive design. If needed, you can use media queries to adjust the layout for different devices.
Color Contrast:

Ensure that the color contrast between the text and background meets accessibility standards. The current color choices seem fine, but it's always good to check for accessibility.
Commenting:

Consider adding comments in your CSS to explain specific sections or styling decisions. It can be helpful for you or anyone else who might work on the code in the future.
Overall, your CSS is well-written and should provide a good foundation for styling your website. Keep up the good work!
